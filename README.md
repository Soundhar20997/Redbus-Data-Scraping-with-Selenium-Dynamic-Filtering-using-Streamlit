# Redbus-Data-Scraping-with-Selenium-Dynamic-Filtering-using-Streamlit
# Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing bus travel data from Redbus. By using Selenium for web scraping and Streamlit for dynamic filtering, it enables efficient data-driven decision-making in the transportation industry. The scraped data includes key details like bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability, stored in a SQL database and made accessible through an interactive web application.

# Skills and Tech Stack
Skills Learned:

- Web Scraping using Selenium
- Data Handling with Python, SQL
- Interactive Application Building with Streamlit

Tech Stack:

- Python: Main language for scripting and data manipulation.
- Selenium: For automating data extraction from the Redbus website.
- SQL: Used to store and retrieve scraped data.
- Streamlit: Framework for creating an interactive user interface.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

#	Problem Statement

The transportation industry can benefit immensely from data on travel patterns, schedules, pricing, and customer preferences. The "Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application" project automates the extraction and filtering of bus data to improve operational efficiency and support strategic planning. By providing a structured approach to gathering, storing, and analyzing this information, the project empowers travel aggregators, market analysts, customer service teams, and competitors to gain insights for better decision-making.

# Business Use Cases

The application can be used in a variety of business scenarios:

- Travel Aggregators: Provide real-time bus schedules and seat availability to users.
- Market Analysis: Analyze travel trends and customer preferences to drive market insights.
- Customer Service: Enhance user experience by offering customized travel options.
- Competitor Analysis: Compare prices and service quality with competitors.

# Approach
# 1. Data Scraping
Using Selenium, this project automates the extraction of data from Redbus, including:
- Bus routes
- Schedules
- Prices
- Seat availability

# 2. Data Storage
The scraped data is stored in a SQL database, structured to allow easy retrieval and manipulation for filtering in the Streamlit application.

# 3. Streamlit Application
The Streamlit application provides an interactive UI that allows users to:
- Flter buses by type, route, price range, rating, and seat availability.
- View relevant information on bus schedules, pricing, and travel options.
  
# 4. Data Analysis and Filtering
The app uses SQL queries to retrieve filtered data based on user inputs, making it easy to analyze bus travel data dynamically.
